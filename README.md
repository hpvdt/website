# HPVDT Website
This is the code for the team website: https://hpvdt.ca/. There are a few groups of files that are helpful for website updates in this folder and the resources folder.

* HTML
  * The text and content for the four pages of the website are in the html files in this main folder
  * For example, index.html represents the main page and sponsors.html shows the sponsors page

* CSS
  * Style (like colors, spacing, font size) are defined in website/resources/css/style.css

* Photos
    * All photo files are available in resources/img except for the big header background images, which are in resources/css/cssimg
  
[comment]: <> (Will add how to update this website/test it)

To update the code, we use Visual Studio Code. We preview the changes before making pull requests on GitHub with the Live Server extension. 

Contact me on the HPVDT Discord or at <georgez.wang@mail.utoronto.ca> if you have questions or ideas to add to the website!
