# HPVDT Website
This is the code for the team website: https://hpvdt.ca/. 

## Folder Organization
These are a few groups of files that are helpful for website updates. 

| Folder/file | Purpose |
| --- | ---|
| `resources/css/style.css` | Style (like spacing, colors, and font size) for all website headers, buttons, and text boxes. Also defines the three big background header images|
| `resources/img` | All other website images|
| `index.html` | Text and content of main website page. |
| `vendors` | Has ionicons for icons and other random tools|


## Updating the Website
[comment]: <> (Will add how to update this website/test it)

To update the code, we use Visual Studio Code. We preview the changes before making pull requests on GitHub with the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer). Feel free to delete files and unused code since it's relatively easy to find old content through GitHub version control.

Contact us @hpvdt/webmasters or on discord if you have questions or ideas to add to the website!
