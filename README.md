# HPVDT Website
This is the code for the team website: https://hpvdt.ca/. There are a few groups of files that are helpful for website updates in this folder and the resources folder.

* HTML
  * The text and content for the four pages of the website are in the html files in this main folder
  * For example, index.html represents the main page and sponsors.html shows the sponsors page

* CSS
  * Style (like colors, spacing, font size) are defined in website/resources/css/style.css

* Photos
    * All photo files are available in resources/img except for the big header background images, which are in resources/css/cssimg
