                <p>The Human-Powered Vehicles Design Team (HPVDT) is a student organization at the University of Toronto that is focused on the design and construction of innovative, high-performance, human-powered vehicles. Our goal is to provide students with practical, hands-on experience in engineering design while promoting efficiency, sustainability and the use of human power as a means of reducing society's impact on the environment.<br><br></p>

                <p class="intro"><span>Our current focus: </span> Designing a high-speed aerodynamic bicycle, capable of reaching speeds well in excess of 100 km/hr, while still having the utility necessary for carrying groceries and travelling safely within the city. The bike will compete in the annual American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Human-Powered Vehicle Challenge, a race specifically focused on the utilitarian aspects of the bike. As well, we will compete in the World Human-Powered Speed Challenge, where streamlined bicycles head to set speed records on a 5 mile stretch of road near Battle Mountain, Nevada. <br><br></p>

            <div class="row js--wp-1">
                <p class="intro"><span>Experience:</span> As a member of the team, you will learn how to work with composites, such as carbon fibre, and other advanced materials. You will also be a part of the design process of the aerodynamic, mechanical, structural and electrical components of the bicycle. You will gain hands-on experience with building streamlined vehicles, as well as how to disassemble and reassemble bicycle components. Committed members will also have an opportunity to become design leads or team executives, which provides leadership and management experience. The team is also often invited to attend various events and conferences where team members can showcase their work and network with professionals in related fields.

                        <p>Blueshift is a fully faired super-recumbent delta camera tricycle with three wheels on a short wheel base.  This design has ideal characteristics for our project goals.  The delta wheel placement and short wheelbase allows us to accommodate a tight turning radius without increasing the frontal area of the fairing.  The flat rider position produces a low center of mass which provides good lateral stability under both cornering accelerations and high speed crosswinds.  The drivetrain and shifting range provides us with a wide range of 90 RPM speeds from 26 km/h to 118 km/h.

Zephyr uses partial aerodynamic fairings fore and aft of the rider's body to provide a 22% drag reduction relative to a standard aerobar position. This vehicle dominated all the races at ASME HPVC North 2019, lapping the second place vehicle seven times during the endurance race. To demonstrate real world usability, the vehicle completed a 350 km 3 day tour from Toronto to Kingston during summer 2019. <br><br>

                        <p>Inspired by Celero, Arbiter was developed with the practical high-speed commuter in mind. Its three-wheeled configuration was stable at low speeds and highly maneuverable when slaloming down obstacle courses at high speed. Arbiter was the first vehicle we’ve completed on time before driving out to compete at the annual ASME HPVC competitions. Arbiter finished with 2nd in Design and Innovation categories at ASME HPVC East 2018 and was also featured on Daily Planet! <br>

                        <p class="captain-paragraph"> Josh decided to study mechanical engineering because he loves engineering design and 3D-modelling. He joined the team in 2016 because of the great opportunity it provides to design and build in a creative environment with many capable engineers willing to help each other. Josh is also skilled in programming, electronics, and computer simulation.<br>Among other things, Josh is interested in powerlifting, finance, and entrepreneurship. He was part of Iron Dragons in 2018-2019.

                    <p class= "long-copy">Luke joined the team in 2016 as a way to learn and practice skills that are not taught in the classroom, such as manufacturing and advanced design. He has participated in various aspects of the design and manufacturing of Tempest, Arbiter and Zephyr. Some of his personal goals within the team are to become comfortable with all the areas of the full design and manufacturing process, and to pass on what he knows to the newer members of the teams. When he's not building or designing he's probably filming something to put on the team's YouTube channel. Outside of the team Luke is currently completing his PEY at an engineering consulting firm in Mississauga. In his free time he lives and breathes all forms of hockey and baseball, both as a player and a coach.</p></div>
