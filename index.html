            <p>The Human-Powered Vehicles Design Team (HPVDT) is a student organization at the University of Toronto that is focused on the design and construction of innovative, high-performance, human-powered vehicles. Our goal is to provide students with practical, hands-on experience in engineering design while promoting efficiency, sustainability and the use of human power as a means of reducing society's impact on the environment.<br><br></p>
        </div>
        <div class="row js--wp-1">
            <p class="intro"><span>Our current focus: </span> Designing high-speed aerodynamic vehicles, capable of reaching speeds well in excess of 100 km/hr on pure human power. We compete annually in the World Human-Powered Speed Challenge, where streamlined bicycles race and set land speed records on a 5 mile stretch of road near Battle Mountain, Nevada. We have also previously competed in the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Human Powered Vehicle Challenge, where the utilitarian and practical aspects of our vehicles are tested in a series of design and race events. <br><br></p>
        </div>
        <div class="row js--wp-1">
            <p class="intro"><span>Experience:</span> As a member of the team, you will learn how to work with composites, such as carbon fibre, and other advanced materials. You will also be a part of the design process of the aerodynamic, mechanical, structural and electrical components of the bicycle. You will gain hands-on experience with building streamlined vehicles, as well as how to disassemble and reassemble bicycle components. Committed members will also have an opportunity to become design leads or team executives, which provides leadership and management experience. The team is also often invited to attend various events and conferences where team members can showcase their work and network with professionals in related fields.

                <h3><b>Typhoon</b></h3>
                <p> Typhoon was designed as a learning and development project. The shell and structure were built and 
                    designed in the summer of 2024. The intention of the project was to simplify the design and construction 
                    and focus on the basics, teaching team members valuable skills and allowing them to gain experience for 
                    future projects to come. This bike was pulled from the same mold as Votex and its internals and drivetrain 
                    are a hybrid between the original vortex one and the newer cyclone and tempest designs.

                <p> The watercraft is the beginning of an entirely new avenue of exploration for the team and our first venture 
                    into surface vehicles. The project is inspired by the Dupont Prize - a competition in the 1990s to build 
                    the first human powered boat to go 20 knots (37.04 km/h). In the end no one was successful in reaching this 
                    feat and the prize was awarded to Decavitator who went 18.5 knots (34.262 km/h). Since then others have 
                    tried to set the world record including super phoenix who reached a top speed of 18.6 knots, however no one 
                    has reached 20 knots. Our ambitious goal with this project is to reach that speed and break the water speed 
                    record for human powered propulsion.

                <p> In 2022, HPVDT overhauled the drivetrains, internal structure and fairings for Cyclone and Tempest, 
                    the team's ASME HPVC entries in 2016 and 2017. This project helps HPVDT's new members get design, 
                    building and streamliner racing experience after the return from the COVID-19 Pandemic. Ultimately, 
                    more than 10 new team members rode Cyclone and Tempest at the 2022 and 2023 Waterford HPRA, 
                    and multiple team riders achieved speeds over 60 miles per hour at the 2022 World Human Powered 
                    Speed Challenge while operating Cyclone.

                    <br><br>

                    In 2023 the bikes were again improved and in 2023 and 2024 more than 20 new riders rode them. In 
                    the summer of 2024 the bikes were refinished and painted for the 2024 WHPSC where both Cyclone 
                    and Tembest were run. Cyclone achieving a speed of 65.52 mph and Tempest 61.56 mph (105.44 and 99.07 
                    km/h respectively).

                <p>We were building a tandem human powered aircraft to compete for the long
                    standing Kremer International Marathon Prize. Our aircraft was being built to
                    fly a distance of 42 km (a marathon) in one hour or less. In addition to the
                    speed and distance conditions, the aircraft had to also be able to turn
                    repeatedly to navigate the specified figure eight course. When completed, we
                    expect it to be the most advanced human powered aircraft ever constructed.

                    <p>Blueshift was a fully faired super-recumbent delta camera tricycle with three wheels on a short wheel base. This design has ideal characteristics for its project goals. The delta wheel placement and short wheelbase allowed us to accommodate a tight turning radius without increasing the frontal area of the fairing. The flat rider position produceed a low center of mass which provided good lateral stability under both cornering accelerations and high speed crosswinds.  The drivetrain and shifting range provided us with a wide range of speeds, from as low as 26 km/h to as high as 118 km/h.

                    <p>A new take on the most common human powered vehicle in the world: the upright bicycle. Zephyr uses partial aerodynamic fairings fore and aft of the rider's body to provide a 22% drag reduction relative to a standard aerobar position. This vehicle dominated all the races at ASME HPVC North 2019, lapping the second place vehicle seven times during the endurance race. To demonstrate real world usability, the vehicle completed a 350 km 3 day tour from Toronto to Kingston during summer 2019. <br><br>

                        the 2022-23 outreach director.</p>

                    <br><p class="captain-paragraph">Going forward Lincoln will be leading a new Watercraft 
                        Project to push the limits and attempt to achieve the water speed record for human

                        his interests include topological optimizations and superlatives. Through his role, he 
                        hopes to help the team transition into future human-powered aircraft projects efficiently. 
                        When he’s not in the workshop, you can find him napping. Please don’t though, that’s a little creepy.</p>

                        of engineering entirely. Aryan spends most of his time on the electronics team designing 
                        custom electronics under Savo Bajic. Aryan is directly responsible for the aircraft 
                        control interface, creating custom electronics for a 3-axis joystick. In his off time, 
                        Aryan competes alongside Iron Dragons, a dragonboat team under the university of 
                        Toronto’s faculty of Engineering.</p>

                        in future competitions which requires some training on the recumbent bikes. If he's 
                        not at the workshop you can find him climbing, camping, or drinking his tea.</p>
